        <p>Application by BlueTeam

          Simple Facebook-inspired social network app, written in React.js, as a final project for the javaScript course
          at the Belgrade Institute of Technology.

          The app supports registering/logging in, creating and editing a profile, a profile search function, posting
          and
          deleting new text, image and video posts, as well as commenting.

          The central page is the feed, which shows all the posts by all the users (which can be filtered by type) and
          utilizes infinite scroll.

          The design is fully responsive and based on Bootstrap.</p>
